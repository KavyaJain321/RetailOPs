## ‚ú® About The Project

Many small distributors still rely on manual ledgers, leading to errors and inefficiency. RetailOps solves this by providing a full-stack web application designed to digitize and streamline their core operations. This tool streamlines day-to-day operations, from order creation and stock management to payment tracking and automated customer communication, all from a single, centralized platform.

Built with a modern tech stack, this project demonstrates a practical, real-world application of Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, integrated with the Twilio API for real-time WhatsApp notifications.

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is deployed on **Render**. The live deployment on Render is configured for continuous integration. A new build is automatically triggered upon every push to the `main` branch. All sensitive credentials, such as API keys and database URIs, are securely managed as Environment Variables in the Render dashboard, not in the code.
